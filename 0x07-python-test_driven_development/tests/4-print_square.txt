How to use Print Square
=======================

``print_square()`` is a method that takes one argument size, 
size must be an interger or otherwise raises an error.

print Square prints a square with `#` depending on th size

::

	>>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
	>>> print_square(4)
	####
	####
	####
	####

Printing asquare of size 0 also works:

::

	>>> print_square(0)

::

	>>> print_square(1)
	#

The size of a square cannot be negative:

::

	>>> print_square(-1)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: size must be >= 0

It also doesn't work with floating point values:

::

	>>> print_square(4.0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: size must be an interger
	
	>>> print_square(-1.1)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: size must be an interger

NON NUMBERS
============

``print square`` throws an error when size is a string

::

	>>> print_square(a)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	NameError: name 'a' is not defined

	>>> print_square("b")
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: size must be an interger
